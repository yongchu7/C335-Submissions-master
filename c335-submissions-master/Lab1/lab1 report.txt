lab1 report
I accomplished the step1: set up my SHH key and make a new c335-submissions repository,but I find some collaborators doesn't have the github account, so I cannot add them. The only one I can add is the geobrown@indiana.edu. I also connect the github with git bash(putty) with the support from website(http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/classes/spring2016/csci/c343-yye/github.php) so I can upload lab assignment through bash. For step2, I almost finish the whole tutorial, and I think I am pretty familiar with the UNIX command. I did meet some difficulties when I was setting up the editor. I only use vi as C programming editor before, so emacs seems unfamiliar for me. I install the emacs and go through the tutorial. When I was trying compile the Hello World program, I find I don't install the gcc compiler collection, and this gcc is most tricky part when I was doing the lab. Windows needs MinGW to install the gcc, and when I finish the installtion and run the code, the error shows up(collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status).I still cannot figure out why this error is appeared. The editor is still broken, and I just write my hello world code without test it. I think the guide for the helloworld program is pretty clearly, so I just follow the guide and write my code.After all I should say this lab let me learn a lot of knowledge about the UNIX code and how to use emacs, and this lab also let me find out there are lots of resources on the google, and google helps me solve lots of problems I met, but I still think the class should not cancel the first lab, so students can get some help from classmates and TAs, and at least set all tools for this class.
