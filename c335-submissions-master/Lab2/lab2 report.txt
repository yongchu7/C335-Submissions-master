From this lab, I face lots of difficults when I try to figure out how to do the dumping memory in gdb, but my partner helps me a lot for this step. We google that for the basic format of the algorithm of this dump function and we test many times with the code then we succeed. At first I have some questions about the makefile things, then I ask my friends for help. Makefile is a simplier way for operation those code. The word count program is not so difficult for me. I finished all the lab assignments and I did learn a lot from this lab like how to makefile and the algorithm.
